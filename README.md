#DESCRIPTION:
This project involves building a basic speech recognition system using an embedded board (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to control devices through voice commands. The system uses a microphone to capture speech, processes it with Python's SpeechRecognition library, and interprets commands (e.g., "turn on the light"). The Raspberry Pi then controls devices like LEDs or motors via GPIO pins based on the recognized commands. This setup can be expanded to control multiple devices and integrate offline speech recognition for more flexibility.
